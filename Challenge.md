# Shapr3D App Engineer Homework

## Problem Statement:

Develop a 3D file converter application for .shapr files, allowing users to import, convert, and manage these files. The application must provide a smooth, high-quality UI and persist data across sessions, ensuring that it meets the expectations of production-ready software..

## Task Description:

Write an 3D file converter application for .shapr files based on the following requirement:
● The user should be able to import .shapr files for conversion into the app.
● These files can be converted to .step, .stl and .obj formats.
● The imported files should be displayed in a list where every item should display a
thumbnail about the file and should contain the already available conversion as
labels and a progressbar if there is a conversion in progress.
● A detailed view can be opened per item which displays the thumbnail in a bigger
resolution, the active conversion progress and more details about the files, like file
size, both for input and output files.

You don't have to implement the real conversion, for iOS we provide a simple mock
implementation below. The input files can be of any complexity and the conversion can take
arbitrary time and consume arbitrary resources.
The application should be written for iOS with UIKit using any combination of Swift,
Objective-C and C/C++.

## Requirements:
● Smooth, high quality and pleasing UI
● Imported and converted files should be persisted between separate runs
● Allow multiple conversion in parallel
● At the same time respect device and OS capabilities

## General guidelines:
The code that you submit must be production ready, assuming you were to release this
functionality to millions of users. We are expecting high quality software design, extendable
architecture, great performance and overall a demonstration of world-class engineering. We
have great ambitions and that requires a very high quality bar.
Should you have any questions don’t hesitate to contact us, but please note that the problem
is intentionally vaguely defined, as we would like to see how you can balance between time,
product and quality constraints.
    
## Note:

* Ensure adherence to Swift and iOS development best practice.
* Focus on code quality and user experience while meeting performance requirements.
* Reach out with questions if clarification is needed.

## Follow up Discussion:
Be prepared to discuss the following in a 45-minute session:

o   Key design and architecture decisions.
o   Trade-offs made due to time constraints.
o   Assumptions and rationale for implementation choices.
o   Areas for potential improvement and scalability.
